# Stock_Analysis
##Project Overview 
This module for class focused on our friend Steve seeking out more information about Green Energy Stocks.  This challenge specifically focuses on improving the VBA code we initially created for analyzing a short list of stocks by refactoring it.  This editing was intended to increase efficiency, by only looping through the data set once, rather than nested loops.   
We initially set out to find out information about stock DQ, and created macros to tell us information about just that one variable.  We expanded that code outwards once using For loops to generate information about a list of stocks.  Learning how to refractor the data to create a usable spreadsheet that could easily be updatable with new information is the final step in this module .
